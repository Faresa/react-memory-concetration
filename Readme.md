# Memory Game 🃏✨

## Introduction

Welcome to Memory 

## Journey Overview

Throughout the development process, I focused on implementing the core features of the Memory Game while adhering to the provided guidelines and constraints. 
Here's a brief overview:

- **Frontend Framework**: Leveraged a React to build the solution.
- **Player Names Collection**: Implemented a modal popup to collect players' names before starting the game.
- **Card Shuffle**: Shuffled the deck of cards before the game starts to ensure randomness.
- **Card Flipping**: Allowed players to click on the back of a card to reveal its face.
- **Matching Logic**: Implemented logic to check if the two flipped cards match and handle the outcome accordingly.
- **Score Tracking**: Tracked players' scores and determined the winner based on the number of matched pairs.
- **Animations**: Added animations for card flips, modal popups, and other interactive elements.
